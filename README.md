-SKILLS USED-
* JavaScript
* Object-Oriented Programming
* CSS
* HTML
* GitHub

-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* In this project, I created a browser-based, word guessing game using JavaScript and OOP to select a random, hidden phrase.
* A player tries to guess the prase by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or using their connected keyboard.
* Using JavaScript, I created a Game class for managing the game, and a Phrase class to help with creating an array of Phrase objects.
* My code chooses a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and puts those letters onto the game board.
* Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. 
* If the letter is in the phrase, the game board displays the chosen letters on the screen.
* A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).
* If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears and if the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
* A player can guess a letter only once, after which my programming disables that letter on the onscreen keyboard and connected keyboard.

-STYLE CHANGES-
* Correct letter guesses have a green background on onscreen keyboard.
* Incorrect letter guesses have a red background on onscreen keyboard.
